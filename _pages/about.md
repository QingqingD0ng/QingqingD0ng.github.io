# ABOUT ME

Hi! I am a master's student of computer science at Saarland University. I am tired of fancy LinkedIn-style self-introductions, and I want to do this in the simplest and most authentic way. I believe there is a calling for everybody on Earth to fulfill. And to me, that calling is learning knowledge and helping others. I love to make this world a better place to live, even if just for one moment, one person at a time.

My personal interests include doing meditation and yoga, going to the gym with my gym buddy, inventing new ways to cook, spreading cat memes, and binge-eating chips.

My research interests lie in interdisciplinary studies such as societal computing, ethical AI, and human-centered computing.
