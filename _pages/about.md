# ABOUT ME

Hi! I am a master student in computer science in Saarland University. I am really tired of fancy dazzling linkedin style self introductions and I want to do this in the simplest and most authentic way. I believe there is a calling for everybody on the earth to fullfill. And to me that calling is learning knowledge and helping others. I love to make this world a better place to live, even just for one moment one person at a time. 

My personal interests include doing meditation and yoga, going to gym with my gym buddy, inventing new ways to cook, spreading cat memes and binge eating chips.

My resaerch interest lies in interdisciplinary studies such as socialtal computing, ethical AI and human-centered computing. if you want to know more about me, click [here](./docs/CV.pdf) tp download my CV.
