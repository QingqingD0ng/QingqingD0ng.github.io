# ABOUT ME

I am a Ph.D. student in the preparatory phase at the [**CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security**](https://cispa.de/en), advised by [**Dr. Yang Zhang**](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (**BUPT**) in 2022. 

My research interests lie in the field of **Trustworthy Machine Learning** and **Privacy**. Specifically, I am interested in developing algorithms that can detect and mitigate adversarial attacks on machine learning models. I am also interested in exploring the intersection of machine learning and privacy, and how we can design algorithms that can learn from sensitive data without compromising the privacy of individuals.
